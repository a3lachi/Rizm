# A compiler in Haskell ?  

I've taken a course in my school 2 years ago about functional programming with Scheme (dialect of among the LISP family) and falled deeply in love with it, it's another algorithmic approach and requires different toughts chaining, a delicious playground for a pattern seeking animal, my brain. 

> LISP stands for LISt Processing

A compiler processes a list of characters, that can be transformed to strings, types, tokens, structure node and finally binary code. As much as I know so far.
